# Getting Started Sample for Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit: Intel Implicit SPMD Program Compiler


Intel Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC) optimizes single program multiple data kernels for execution on modern SIMD hardware. ISPC is often used in conjunction with high performing Embree and OpenVKL based programs. ISPC compiles a C programming language variant. The language has helpful constructs for modern parallelism. This sample introduces Intel ISPC within the scope of the Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit (Render Kit).

## Purpose

This getting started sample program, `simple`, performs an element wise operation on an input float array. The output is written to stdout.
The sample builds two programs with Intel IPSC. The programs exhibit the same output behavior.
The first program is targeted to x86_64 systems with SSE2 extensions (introduced in the early 2000s).
The second program is multitargeted for systems with SSE2, SSE4, AVX (AVX1), AVX2, and AVX512SKX extensions. The program will runtime detect the highest target extension capability. The program will then run the codepath associated with that capability on the target system.
This initial sample demonstrates Intel ISPC usage with an introductory program running on CPU only. Other Intel Embree and Intel Open VKL sample programs demonstrate usage of ISPC in conjuction with those libraries.
See more about programming with ISPC with the [documentation](https://ispc.github.io/documentation.html).


## Key Implementation Details

- Our c++ program has the typical main entry point defined in simple.cpp. The final program is linked to the compiled ISPC kernel function defined in simple.ispc.
- The function prototype for the kernel is introduced by way of this preprocessor code:
```
#include "simple_ispc.h"
```
- simple.ispc contains the implementation of the kernel function.
- The simple_ispc.h header file is generated by the `ispc` compiler driver when it compiles simple.ispc.
- The first program builds the kernel targeted to SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2) ISA extensions introduced on CPUs in the early 2000's.
- Compiling the second program will create an object per ISA extension target, as well as a primary kernel linking object. All objects are linked to generate the final binary. The program will runtime detect the appropriate codepath for the target platform.

###Targeting

- To target ISA extension capability introduced in newer x86_64 processors, see the [targeting table](https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html#selecting-the-compilation-target) in the release notes.
- For targeting ARM64 with NEON extensions. See the [target selection](https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html#selecting-the-compilation-target) in the release notes. Edit the CMakeLists.txt file accordingly for the build step.
- For targeting Intel Graphics Processors, see the article for [ISPC on Gen](https://ispc.github.io/ispc_for_gen.html).
