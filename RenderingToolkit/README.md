# Getting Started Samples for IntelÂ® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit (RenderKit)

TBD

You can find more information at the [ Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit portal](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/rendering-toolkit.html).

Users learn how to build and run samples for the component libraries in Render Kit.

## License

TBD

Code samples are licensed under the MIT license. See
[License.txt](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/blob/master/License.txt) for details.

Third party program Licenses can be found here: [third-party-programs.txt](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/blob/master/third-party-programs.txt)

## Requirements

To build and run the samples you will need a compiler toolchain and imaging tools:

Compiler:
- MSVS 2019 on Windows* OS
- On other platforms a C++11 compiler and a C99 compiler. (Ex: gcc/g++/clang)

Imaging Tools:
- An image **display program** for .ppm and .pfm filetypes . Ex: [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/)
- An image **converter** for .ppm filetypes, .pfm filetypes, and endian conversions. Ex: [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/)

## Getting Started Samples

Please try the getting started sample programs in order.  Outputs of a sample may serve as inputs for another sample.
